# ATAK Plugin Example

This is an example plugin for ATAK that contains examples of:

* Listening to outgoing messages from ATAK and Toast their type to the screen
* Sending incoming messages to ATAK (in this case, a fake "Green HQ" map marker at lat: 0, lon: 0)
* A icon overlaid in the lower right corner of the screen that updates every 2 seconds
* A basic plugin UI with a Spinner
* Different icon types (map overlay, menu, settings menu)
